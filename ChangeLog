 * 0.23
  ftpcloudfs ported from python-cloudfiles to python-swiftclient
  - Using python-swiftfiles instead of the abandoned python-cloudfiles
  - The code has been tidied up for better maintainability and there are 
    some performance improvements. The functionality should be the same,
	but please test this release before upgrading your production systems!

  From now on the project will focus on OpenStack Object Storage (swift);
  although Rackspace Cloud Files is still compatible.

  If you want to keep using python-cloudfiles, please use ftp-cloudfs 0.22.
